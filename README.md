# FightCOVID19-AutoAmbu
An autonomous support for Ambu devices to help breath and fight Covid19.

This project is aimed to design a Concept for an Automatic Ambu Support to be used in emergency conditions where there are not enough personnel to assist people who are in need for a breath support. It is important to clarify that this project is not the design of a certified medical product. If we will be able to implement a prototype, it will be subject to a test phase in order to prove its features. A medical certification of such prototype will be the final important goal.

Several projects are flourishing in these days. This project is meant to be a contribution with some ideas, totally for free forever, available to all community.

The document "AutoAMBU.docx" describes the concept. It will be periodically updated to include new contributions.
